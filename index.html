        <p>A debate is a discussion or structured contest about an issue or a resolution. A formal debate
            involves two sides: one supporting a resolution and one opposing it. Such a debate is bound by
            rules previously agreed upon. Debates may be judged in order to declare a winning side. Debates,
            in one form or another, are commonly used in democratic societies to explore and resolve issues
            and problems. Decisions at a board meeting, public hearing, legislative assembly, or local
            organization are often reached through discussion and debate. Indeed, any discussion of a
            resolution is a form of debate, which may or may not follow formal rules (such as Robert’s Rules
            of Order). In the context of a classroom, the topic for debate will be guided by the knowledge,
            skill, and value outcomes in the curriculum.</p>
