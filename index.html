        <p>A debate is a discussion or structured contest about an issue or a resolution. A formal debate
            involves two sides: one supporting a resolution and one opposing it. Such a debate is bound by
            rules previously agreed upon. Debates may be judged in order to declare a winning side. Debates,
            in one form or another, are commonly used in democratic societies to explore and resolve issues
            and problems. Decisions at a board meeting, public hearing, legislative assembly, or local
            organization are often reached through discussion and debate. Indeed, any discussion of a
            resolution is a form of debate, which may or may not follow formal rules (such as Robert’s Rules
            of Order). In the context of a classroom, the topic for debate will be guided by the knowledge,
            skill, and value outcomes in the curriculum.</p>

                     which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190-200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope
                      of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament is held every four years and involves 32 national 
                      teams competing over four weeks. It is the most prestigious men's football tournament in the world, and the most widely viewed
                       and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding the Olympic Games. Similarly, the FIFA Women's World Cup has been played every
